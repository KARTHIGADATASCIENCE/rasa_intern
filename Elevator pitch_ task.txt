Hi, I am Karthiga Alias Amali from Karaikal. I am currently pursuing  Postgraduate Data Science at Bishop Heber college set to graduate in 2026 . I come from a strong mathematics background, having completed my undergraduate in Mathematics from AGCW. Over past years I have built a strong foundation in Python, R, SQL, Machine learning and data visualization. I'm also gaining hands on experience in deep learning  frameworks like Keras and tensorflow. 

I have completed multiple internships both online and offline  where I applied data preprocessing, machine learning and python based analysis to real world. I am deeply interested in areas like predictive analysis, generative AI and LLM, I have presented research papers on advanced AI topics, including cancer prediction using AI and ML 5.0 for enhanced human- AI interaction.

what sets me apart is my drive to constantly learn and apply new technologies. I have participated in conferences, hackathon and workshops.
currently, I am seeking opportunities for roles such as Data Analyst, Junior Data Scientist, AI/ML research intern, where I can contribute to real world projects grow professionally and built a strong career foundations in AI and Data Science. My goal is to contribute meaningful AI innovations.
